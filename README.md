I created 2 files, first one main.py is just crawling script that is not even saving to csv/json.

First file You can start in termianl with command -> python main.py "link"

Saving to file does not work couse I wanted to have basic working version. 

After you run this script its gonna take a minute or two and script gonna start printing titles with internal and external links, we have to wait as long as we gonna get big dict() with internal links. 

Second file second_main.py is crawling with asyncio and saving to file json / csv.
Second file You can start by typing in terminal -> python second_main.py 
You don't have to put link or --file csv/json in the second file couse url is static set to https://crawler-test.com/ 

I didn't had enough time to work on this to work with CLI. 

After srcipt end working you gonna get 3 files.
Crawler.json, Crawler.csv and Crawler.txt

Txt is a structure of site (second task from https://git.profil-software.com/recruitment-10-2022/recruitment-task-backend-internship)


I have 2 files couse I spended a lot of time on this first one and I would love if U check that file also. 

I know that maybe it's not working best but I puted all my heart into that and I have hope that's we gonna have possibility to talk about the code.
